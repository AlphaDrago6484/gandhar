            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the statistical information of the match. I personally love cricket because it is so fun and you can play with your friends. If you ask me it is the best sport in the world!!!!

            My name is Gandhaar Srinivasan. I am 8 years old and am about to go into 3rd Grade. I live in Nahar Amrit Shakti, which is located in Mumbai, India. As you know, I love cricket. I go for cricket coaching and want to become a cricketer when I grow up. I am an all rounder. In bowling I am a pacer and am a right-handed batsman. As you know my idols are the Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma, and the Indian all-rounder, Hardik Pandya. I love watching the Indian Premier League. My favorite team is the Mumbai Indians.
